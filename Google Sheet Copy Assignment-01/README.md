# Web Application Mimicking Google Sheets

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a web application that replicates the core functionalities of Google Sheets. The focus is on implementing essential spreadsheet features such as mathematical functions, data quality operations, efficient data entry, and user interactions.

## Features Implemented
### Spreadsheet Interface
- Basic UI resembling Google Sheets
- Structured cell-based layout with basic formatting
- Support for cell selection and data input

### Mathematical Functions
- **SUM Function**: Calculates the sum of a given range of numerical values

## Features in Progress / To Be Implemented
### Spreadsheet Enhancements
- Drag functionalities for cell selection and content manipulation
- Cell dependencies to dynamically update formula-based calculations
- Row and column operations (insertion, deletion, resizing)

### Mathematical Functions
- **AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNT** functions

### Data Quality Functions
- **TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, FIND_AND_REPLACE**

### Data Entry and Validation
- Establish stricter validation mechanisms for different data types

### Testing Mechanism
- Implement structured testing for function validation with user data

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries**: SheetJS, Handsontable (for potential future implementation)
- **Backend (Planned Enhancements)**: Node.js / Flask

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Tejugowda2001/Zeotap.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Zeotap
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the application.

## Next Steps
- Gain proficiency in **JavaScript frameworks** like React or Vue
- Implement **saving/loading functionality** for spreadsheet persistence
- Enhance **UI/UX** for a seamless Google Sheets-like experience
